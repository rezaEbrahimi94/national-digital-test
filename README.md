## Project Overview

This project integrates a robust backend API built with Laravel and a dynamic frontend interface using Next.js. The backend serves as a RESTful API, handling data transactions and business logic, while the frontend provides an interactive user interface, making data consumption and display seamless for the users.

## Accessing the Application

Once both the frontend and backend services are up and running, you will be able to interact with the application through the following URLs:

- **Frontend Application:** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- **Backend API:** [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

These links will allow you to view the frontend interface and access the backend API endpoints directly.

## Project Functionality

- **Backend (Laravel):** Manages and serves data related to GitHub repositories, supporting operations like listing, searching, and sorting repositories based on various criteria.
- **Frontend (Next.js):** Provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the backend data, including features like:
  - Repository search functionality
  - Display of search results in a paginated table
  - Ability to sort results based on different attributes such as name, popularity, and activity

## Additional Information

For detailed instructions on how to use, troubleshoot, and deploy each part of the application, please refer to the respective `README.md` files located in the frontend and backend directories. These documents contain comprehensive guides to ensure smooth setup and operation of both parts of the project.
